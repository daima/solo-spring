/**
 * <p>Specifies that a bean is request scoped.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The request scope is active:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>during the <tt>service()</tt> method of any servlet in the web 
 * application, during the <tt>doFilter()</tt> method of any servlet 
 * filter and when the container calls any <tt>ServletRequestListener</tt> 
 * or <tt>AsyncListener</tt>,</li>
 * <li>during any Java EE web service invocation,</li>
 * <li>during any asynchronous observer method notification,</li>
 * <li>during any remote method invocation of any EJB, during 
 * any asynchronous method invocation of any EJB, during any 
 * call to an EJB timeout method and during message delivery 
 * to any EJB message-driven bean, and</li>
 * <li>during any message delivery to a MessageListener for 
 * a JMS topic or queue obtained from the Java EE component 
 * environment.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The request context is destroyed:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>at the end of the servlet request, after the <tt>service()</tt>
 * method, all <tt>doFilter()</tt> methods, and all <tt>requestDestroyed()</tt>
 * and <tt>onComplete()</tt> notifications return,</li>
 * <li>after the web service invocation completes,</li>
 * <li>after the asynchronous observer notification completes,</li>
 * <li>after the EJB remote method invocation, asynchronous 
 * method invocation, timeout or message delivery completes, or</li>
 * <li>after the message delivery to the <tt>MessageListener</tt> 
 * completes.</li>
