/**
 * <p>Specifies that a bean is session scoped.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The session scope is active:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>during the <tt>service()</tt> method of any servlet 
 * in the web application, during the doFilter() method of 
 * any servlet filter and when the container calls any 
 * <tt>HttpSessionListener</tt>, <tt>AsyncListener</tt> or 
 * <tt>ServletRequestListener</tt>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The session context is shared between all servlet 
 * requests that occur in the same HTTP session. The session 
 * context is destroyed when the HTTPSession times out, 
 * after all <tt>HttpSessionListeners</tt> have been called, 
 * and at the very end of any request in which 
 * <tt>invalidate()</tt> was called, after all filters and 
 * <tt>ServletRequestListeners</tt> have been called.</p>
