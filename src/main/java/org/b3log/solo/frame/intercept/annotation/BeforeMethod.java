/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method will be invoked before a method invocation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * package org.b3log;
 * 
 * publlic class A {
 *     // invoking method
 *     public void oneMethod() {} 
 * 
 *     // intercept method
 *     &#64;BeforeMethod("oneMethod")
 *     public void b() {} 
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * package org.b3log;
 * 
 * public class B {
 *     // intercept method
 *     &#64;BeforeMethod("org.b3log.A#oneMethod")
 *     public void c() {}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then the method org.b3log.A#b and org.b3log.B#c will be invoked before org.b3log.A#oneMethod, and the invocation of methods A#b and B#c
 * are with uncertain order. In addition, method annotated with this annotation has no transitivity, means that a method (e.g. oneMethod) 
 * be invoked in application code maybe trigger it's before/after method (if them exists), others before/after methods (if them exists) of 
 * theses before/after methods of the method (oneMethod) will not be invoked.
